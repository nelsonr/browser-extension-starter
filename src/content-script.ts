// This message could come from anywhere in the extension,
// for example, the popup or background worker, the options page or even another tab.
env.runtime.onMessage.addListener((message) => {
    if (message.action == "hello") {

// In this example, it will be the background worker that will pick it up and send a reply back.
env.runtime.sendMessage({ action: "load" });

// This is just for keeping the TypeScript compiler happy :)
